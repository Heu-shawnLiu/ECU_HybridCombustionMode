ECU Control-based NI Powertrain for NI cRIO
You can download the files to a local device that installs the Labview 2023 (32bit and 64bit) or later
the source requires the VIPM to install the NI powertrain in 32bit LabVIEW and you need to copy the vilib/powertrain control folder
from C:\Program Files(x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW vertion\vi.lib to C:\Program Files(x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW vertion\vi.lib
by the way, you can enjoy the project in LabVIEW by opening the project file which named ECM-EPT.LVPRJ
